# MinecraftForge-Documentation-I18n

This is the internationalized version of MinecraftForge Documentation, designed to provide translated versions of the documentation for users whose native language is not English.

## Why a Fork?

For certain reasons, the official team of MinecraftForge has temporarily excluded the translated versions from their documentation. I fully understand and respect this decision. However, I also believe that the translations provided and proofread by the community can help non-native English speakers reduce comprehension difficulties and minimize translation ambiguities. That's why this project was established.
